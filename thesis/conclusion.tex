\section{Manual and Semiautomatic Evaluation}

In this thesis, we proposed a new method for manual evaluation, called
\metoda{SegRanks}, in which annotators rank short segments (up to six words) of
a translated sentence relatively to each other. The ranking of short segments
is easier for annotators, since the they do not have to read and remember whole
sentences at once. The most promising benefit of this method is that short
segments are often translated identically.  We can take advantage of this in
two ways: First, annotators are shown identical segments only once so that they
do not have to rank them multiple times. Second, the evaluated segments can be
stored together with their ranks in a database, which can be used later to
automatically evaluate unseen sentences or to tune a system's parameters. We
also discussed disadvantages of this method. The most severe ones are that the
extracted segments do not always cover the whole sentence and that the segments
are evaluated without their sentence context.

We developed an easy-to-use and modern annotation interface and conducted a
manual evaluation experiment using the proposed method. We evaluated the
systems which participated in the English-Czech direction in WMT Translation
Task. The measured inter- and intra-annotator $\kappa$ scores (the
normalized agreements) are higher than the corresponding values in the WMT
manual evaluation, which means that our evaluation method is more robust.

To get a final score for each system's translation, we computed how often the
segments of the system were ranked better than other segments (in the context
of the pairwise comparisons). The results of the evaluated systems are quite
similar to the results obtained by the official WMT judgments. However, our
method is not able to correctly distinguish some systems with very similar
quality.
\begin{comment}
The Pearson correlation coefficient between the short segments scores
and the official human scores is 0.978, which is lower than correlations of
some of the best performing automatic metrics (\metric{NIST}, \metric{CDER},
\metric{ELEXR}).
\end{comment}
We manually analyzed the sentences which were ranked high in
the short segment judgments but ranked low in the official WMT judgments to
explain the difference. In most of these sentences, there was a badly
translated part which was, however, not covered with the evaluated short
segments.  The uncovered parts often contained verbs which have a significant
impact on the translation quality. 

To explore the possibility of reusing the collected database to evaluate unseen
translations, we have performed several experiments. In the first one, we
evaluated unseen translations using only the ranks of the segments which were
in the database.  This, however, did not work as expected, because the obtained
scores of unseen systems were significantly overestimated. During the manual
analysis, we identified that the evaluated systems are more likely to agree on
better translations than on worse translations.

\begin{comment}
Although this method cannot be
used for evaluating unseen translations, we found out that errors in machine
translation are unique.
\end{comment}

To avoid evaluating unseen translations only on a not-representative subset of
short segments, we proposed another method. In this method, we evaluated unseen
translations on all the extracted segments. To approximate the rank of an
unseen segment, we took the rank of the closest segment by edit distance. This
method, however, didn't work as well.  The approximated rank was predicted
correctly using the closest segment only in 19.7 \% cases.  In 51.9 \% of the
cases, the predicted rank was better than the original rank. The final scores
of the unseen systems were thus overestimated again.

\begin{comment}
The important observation here is that the candidates are closer to the
better candidates than to the equally good or worse candidates. This is somehow
consistent with the previous finding that errors in machine translation are
unique.
\end{comment}

In another experiment, we extracted the best ranked segments from the collected
database and considered them as good translations. We used them as additional
reference translations for \metric{BLEU}. However, it did not perform better
than original \metric{BLEU} with single reference. 

In the last experiment with the collected database, we tried to use the
database to tune a machine translation system using the MERT method.  We
proposed several variants of \metoda{SegRanks} based metrics adapted for the
MERT tuning. The tuned systems were evaluated by humans against the baseline
system tuned by \metric{BLEU}.  We were able to improve the tuning of the
system using a technique which considered unseen segments as bad and therefore
pushed the system to produce known and already evaluated segments.

Although most of the proposed methods exploiting the collected database did not
work, we tried to identify and analyze root causes of the failures. The main
cause seems to be the fact that errors in machine translation are unique and
that segments produced by more than one system are likely to be of better
quality. This is also related with the fact that translations are more likely
to be closer to better translations than to equally good or worse translations.
Maybe, if we had a more dense database (many more than 10 evaluated systems),
these phenomena would not influence results so adversely.

\section{Automatic Evaluation}

In the second part of this thesis, we summarized the results of the WMT14
Metrics Shared Task which we ran. The shared task assesses the quality of
various automatic machine translation metrics. Judgements collected in the
WMT14 human evaluation served as the golden truth and we checked how well the
metrics predicted the judgements at the level of individual sentences
(sentence-level task) as well as at the level of the whole test set
(system-level task).

In the system-level task, we discussed differences between Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient and Pearson correlation coefficient and decided to
choose Pearson coefficient instead of Spearman's rank coefficient as being
fairer. In the sentence-level task, we introduced a new notation which exactly
specifies the details on Kendall's $\tau$ computation. We also discussed
several variants of Kendall's $\tau$ used in the past and proposed and used a
new variant which does not suffer from shortcomings of other variants.

\begin{comment}
Although sentence-level correlations are significantly higher than they were in
the previous years, they are still much lower than system-level ones. Kendall's
$\tau$ reaches at most 0.45 for the best performing metric in the best language
pair. So, there is quite some research work to be done.

On the system level, the best performing metrics on average in directions into
English are \metric{DiscoTK-party-tuned}, \metric{LAYERED} and
\metric{UPC-STOUT}. The best performing metrics in directions out of English
are \metric{NIST}, \metric{CDER} and \metric{AMBER}. On the sentence level, the
best performing metrics in directions into English are
\metric{DiscoTK-party-tuned}, \metric{BEER} and \metric{REDcombSent}. The best
performing metrics in directions out of English are \metric{BEER},
\metric{Meteor} and \metric{AMBER}.
\end{comment}

We observed two general trends: First, the metrics which employ features on various
linguistic layers are better than other metrics. Second, the metrics which tune
their parameters or weights are also better than other metrics.

We have implemented scripts for metrics evaluation and published them in a
package together with human
judgments\footnote{\url{http://www.statmt.org/wmt14/wmt14-metrics-task.tar.gz}}.
Anyone can therefore reproduce the results and use it to evaluate his or her
metric on the WMT14 data.

\section{Future Work}

The \metoda{SegRanks} method could be improved in several ways to hopefully
avoid its shortcomings. Short segments should be extracted in a way that they
cover either all words in a sentence or the most important parts, for example
predicates. To avoid data sparseness, we should evaluate more systems or
extract segments from the n-best list directly in the case of tuning. An
application of machine learning techniques to predict quality of unseen short
segments should be also examined.

For the evaluation of automatic metrics, the basic principle of the metrics
task will very probably not change. We will also try not to change any
metaevaluation measures again (like we did in WMT13 and WMT14), so that
participants can rely on fixed rules and that results can be more comparable
across years. We expect that new metrics will emerge to be examined in the
task. There are two possible enhancements of the task we think of. First,
automatic metrics should be also evaluated in terms of tuning a system's
parameters.  There was already Tunable Metrics Task organized at WMT11 and we
should consider it again.  Second, the confidence intervals are now computed by
bootstrapping only the human judgments. It would be better if we could
bootstrap new test sets and compute a metric score for each sampled test set.
This would, however, require participants to compute their metric score for
each of the sampled test sets.
