\chapter{Introduction}

The field of machine translation (MT) experienced a very fast development over
the past twenty years. It was primarily caused by the growing power of
computers which allowed researchers to start using statistical methods which
require a lot of computer resources to both learn statistics from data and then
to use them in translation.

In the globalized world we live in, there is a need for translating from one
human language to another. The translation itself is often not easy even for
people who have to be trained for that and therefore well paid. There is
therefore a very high demand for cheap and high-quality machine translation. A
lot of researchers and companies try to satisfy this demand and constantly
improve their translations system. The first presumption for improving your
system is that you know how to measure the improvement.

There are a lot of situations in which you need to evaluate machine
translation. If you are a customer who would like to buy a machine translation
system you want to buy the system which will best suit you. There are many
criteria of MT systems (speed, price, memory consumption, scalability etc.) but
the most important criterion is usually the machine translation quality.
Therefore, you would like to evaluate this quality on a sample of documents you
are going to translate.

If you are a developer of a machine translation system you need to evaluate
your system during various phases of the development process. Let us go through
the phases which need an evaluation in reversed order. From time to time, you
have a ready-to-use system and you would like to have a comparison to systems
of your competitors or another researchers. You can evaluate your system
yourself in a way that the obtained score is comparable to other scores, or you
can participate in a shared evaluation campaign, for instance NIST
OpenMT\footnote{\url{http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/openmt12.cfm}} or at
Workshop on Statistical Machine
Translation\footnote{\url{http://www.statmt.org/wmt14/translation-task.html}}
(WMT) organized by \perscite{wmt14-overview-paper}.  During the day-to-day
development process of your system, you try various configuration, new
components and features. You have to evaluate your system with every change to
know how much the change improved (or sometimes worsen) the translation
quality. Recently, new automatic methods which tune parameters of your system
to directly optimize an evaluation measure emerged.





Unlike other applications of machine learning, the evaluation in machine
translation is not easy at all. The main reason for that is that when
translating an average sentence there is no single correct solution, in fact
there are hundreds of thousands correct translations
\parcite{bojar2013scratching}. Unlike other problems



For all these reasons, we explore the area of evaluating machine translation
quality in this thesis.

\begin{comment}
Machine Translation quality can be measured in two different ways: using human
evaluation or automatic metrics.  Altough human evaluation is considered more
accurate than automatic evaluation, it suffers some disadvantages.  It is slow
and expensive and therefore cannot be used in tuning parameters of statistical
models.

The aim of this thesis is to develop a new semi-automatic evaluation measure,
which would have advantages of both human evaluation and automatic evaluation.
The idea is to evaluate small sentence segments by human and create a database
of such annotation which could be used later to automatically evaluate new
unseen sentences.  This new measure should evaluate MT outputs more similarly
to how human do and still be cheap and fast after the initial database of
annotations is created once. It could be therefore used in tuning parameters of
MT systems.

The important part of the thesis is to design and develop a new annotation
environment which will be used to collect the annotations. This will be then used
to annotate wmt14 test data. The new measure will be analysed and compared to
current manual and automatic evaluation measures.
