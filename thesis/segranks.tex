\chapter{Proposed Semi-Automatic Evaluation Method}
\XXX{Zopakovat motivaci, predstaveni metody}

The method we propose consists of two part. The first part is a way how humans
judge outputs of judged systems. The second part is how to interpret collected
judgments to compute overall scores and rank the systems. We discuss these two
parts in following two sections.

In the WMT official human evaluation humans judge whole sentences. They get
five candidate translations of a given source sentence and their task is to
rank these candidates relatively (ties are allowed). One of disadvantages of
this method is that sentences are quite long and therefore quite hard to
remember for judge to compare them. Also when comparing longer sentences there
are much more aspects in which one sentence can be better or worse than second
sentence and therefore it is more difficult for judges to choose a winner. 

To avoid these disadvantages we propose the following method. Instead of
judging whole sentences we extract shorter segments from candidates and give
them to judges to rank them. In order to extract meaningful segments with the
same meaning from all candidates we do the following procedure: First we parse
the source sentence and then we go recursively down the parsed tree and find
nodes which covers source segments with given maximum length (which is a
parameter of this method). At the end we project these extracted source
segments to their counterpart segments in all candidate sentences using an
automatic alignment.  You can see this process ilustrated in figure
\XXX{nakreslit obrazek}. This extraction method is inspired by \XXX{citovat ten
clanek a stary WMT clanek}.

In \XXX{citovat WMT}, these extracted segments are only highlighted and shown
together with the rest of the sentence to judges. Judges are asked to rank the
segments in the context of whole sentences.

Similarly to \XXX{citovat ten clanek} we use different approach here. We show
the extracted segments without any context (Only with the source segment) and
ask judges to rank them.
