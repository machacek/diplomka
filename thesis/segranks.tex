\chapter{Proposed Semi-Automatic Evaluation Method}

The method we propose consists of two parts. The first part is a way how humans
judge outputs of judged systems. The second part is how to interpret collected
judgments to compute overall scores and rank the systems. We discuss these two
parts in following two sections. \XXX{V tomto odstavci (a asi i v dalsich odstavcich
neni dostatecne zdurazneno, proc je to semi-automaticka metoda, mozna opustit
oznaceni semi-automaticka a pouzit misto toho neco jako Manual Evaluation Method
with posibility to reuse collected judgementes for new systems)}

In the WMT official human evaluation humans judge whole sentences. They get
five candidate translations of a given source sentence and their task is to
rank these candidates relatively (ties are allowed). One of disadvantages of
this method is that sentences are quite long and therefore quite hard to
remember for judge to compare them. Also when comparing longer sentences there
are much more aspects in which one sentence can be better or worse than second
sentence and therefore it is more difficult for judges to choose a winner. 

To avoid these disadvantages we propose the following method. Instead of
judging whole sentences we extract shorter segments from candidates and give
them to judges to rank them. In order to extract meaningful segments with the
same meaning from all candidates we do the following procedure: First we parse
the source sentence and then we go recursively down the parsed tree and find
nodes which covers source segments with given maximum length (which is a
parameter of this method). At the end we project these extracted source
segments to their counterpart segments in all candidate sentences using an
automatic alignment.  You can see this process ilustrated in figure
\XXX{nakreslit obrazek}. This extraction method is inspired by \XXX{citovat ten
clanek a stary WMT clanek}.

In \XXX{citovat WMT}, these extracted segments are only highlighted and shown
to judges together with the rest of the sentence. Judges are asked to rank the
segments in the context of whole sentences. \XXX{Zkontrolovat presne instrukce
z WMT}

We use different approach here which is more similar to that used in
\XXX{citovat ten clanek}. We show the extracted segments without any context
and ask judges to rank them. The only aditional information provided to
annotators is the whole source sentence with the source segment highlighted.
Judges are told that they can imagine the rest of the sentence in which the
ranked segment fits best. They are instructed to penalize only those segments
for which they cannot imagine any appropriate rest of the sentence.

While we are aware that this approach has some disadvantages (wchich we
summarize bellow) there is one significant advantage: it is much more likely
that two systems produce the same translation of a short segment then they
would produce the same translation of a whole sentence. Because we do not show
the sentence context to annotators we can merge the equal segment candidates
into one, so the annotators have less candidate segments to rank. This also
allows us to reuse already collected human judgements later to evaluate a new
system which was not in the set of annotated systems (we experiment with this
in section \ref{evaluating-new-systems}) or to tune parameters of a system (we
experiment with this in section \ref{tuning-systems}).
