Abstract: We explore both manual and automatic methods of machine translation
evaluation. We propose a manual evaluation method in which annotators rank only
translations of short segments instead of whole sentences, which results in
easier and more efficient annotation. We have conducted an annotation
experiment and evaluated a set of MT systems using this method. The obtained
results are very close to the official WMT14 evaluation results. We also use
the collected database of annotations to automatically evaluate new, unseen
systems and to tune parameters of a statistical machine translation system.
The evaluation of unseen systems, however, does not work and we analyze the
reasons. To explore the automatic methods, we organized Metrics Shared Task
held during the Workshop of Statistical Machine Translation in years 2013 and
2014. We report the results of the last shared task, discuss various
metaevaluation methods and analyze some of the participating metrics.
